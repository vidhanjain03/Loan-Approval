# Loan Prediction Problem Set

## Project Description
The project's goal was to create a model that was trained using a specified dataset and then classify labels for test data.

### Project Pipeline: 
1. Import the data
2. Analyze the distribution of data for both types of features
3. Exploration, pattern recognition, and data analysis
4. Wrangled the data
5. For the dataset, I created and trained the necessary model (In this case random forest algorithm) 
6. Making predictions

### Technologies Used:
1. Software IDE: Jupyter Notebook
2. Languages: Python3
3. Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Random Forest Classifier

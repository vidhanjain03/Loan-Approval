# Loan Prediction Problem Set

## Project Description
The Aim of the project is to write a supervised machine learning model from scarth in order to classify the labels. Dataset used for classification is loan given to previous people.

### Project Pipeline: 
* Import the data
* Analyze the distribution of data for both types of features
* Exploration, pattern recognition, and data analysis
* Wrangled the data
* For the dataset, I created and trained the necessary model (In this case random forest algorithm) 
* Making predictions

### Technologies Used:
1. Software IDE: Jupyter Notebook
2. Languages: Python3
3. Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Random Forest Classifier

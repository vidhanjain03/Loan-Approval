# Loan Prediction Problem Set

## Project Description
The project's goal is to create a supervised machine learning model from scratch to categorise the labels. 
Dataset is made up of consumer information entered into an online application form. These information include gender, marital status, education level, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and other characteristics.

### Project Pipeline: 
* Import the data
* Find the features which can contribute in classification, if require do feature engineering.
* Convert data into numerical form.
* Split data into train and test.
* Write the model and train it on data.
* Find the optimal parameters for accurate prediction.
* Make prediction on test data

### Technologies Used:
* Software IDE: `Jupyter Notebook`
* Languages: `Python3`
* Python Libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

## Model (Random Forest)
Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset. Ensambling is used to avoid the problem of overfitting.

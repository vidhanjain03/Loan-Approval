# Loan Prediction Problem Set

## Project Description
The project's goal is to create a supervised machine learning model from scratch to categorise the labels. 
Dataset is made up of consumer information entered into an online application form. These information include gender, marital status, education level, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and other characteristics.

### Project Pipeline: 
* Import the data
* Find the features which can contribute in classification, if require do feature engineering.
* Convert data into numerical form.
* Split data into train and test.
* Write the model and train it on data.
* Find the optimal parameters for accurate prediction.
* Make prediction on test data

### Technologies Used:
* Software IDE: Jupyter Notebook
* Languages: Python3
* Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Random Forest Classifier
Random forest classifier is ensambled decision tree model. It is used in order to avoid the problem of overfitting.
